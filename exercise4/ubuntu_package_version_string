version string:  1.3-4ubuntu5.2~ppa2

1. What is the upstream version?
1.3. The upstream version is the one before the hyphen
4 is the debian version of the package
ubuntu5.2 is the 5.2 ubuntu version of the debian package

2. What is the meaning of the "~" (tilde) character, and why was it used there?
The "~" character is defined to sort before anything else. It is used to insert a version before a standard one.
In this case is used to compare the ubuntu official package against a personal package archive having version 2. PPAs are create and distributed by developers through ubuntu repositories that are low-security alternatives to official packages.

3. Is this a sync from a Debian package or does it have Ubuntu modifications? Why?
The package has Ubuntu modification that contains patches/fixes on the original debian package code 

4. If you were going to prepare a change to that package and upload it to the same place where it is, what would the new version string be and why?
The new version string would be 1.3-4ubuntu5.2~ppa3 and the reason is the one explained above: this is a PPA package and the version is against the official package version. This version is the final number of the string.
